#  Taskflow

> Empowering African Community Cooperatives through Digital Task Management

---

##  Project Overview

**Taskflow** is a web-based task tracking application designed specifically for African community cooperatives, including farmers' cooperatives, microfinance groups, savings groups, and community development organizations.


---

## Problem Statement

In many African communities, cooperatives and community groups manage complex workflows spanning agriculture, microfinance, and community services. Traditional pen-and-paper methods or WhatsApp groups lead to:

- **Lost accountability** when tasks slip through the cracks
- **Difficulty tracking** who is responsible for what and when
- **No visibility** into group priorities and progress
- **Communication gaps** between members across different locations
- **Limited reporting** on group activity and achievements

These challenges prevent community groups from operating efficiently and scaling their impact.

**Our Solution:** A simple, accessible task management platform that brings digital organization to African cooperatives, enabling them to track agricultural tasks, financial obligations, community activities, and more - all in one place.

##  Target Users

### Primary Users:
1. **Community Cooperatives** - Agricultural groups managing crop cycles, harvests, and farm maintenance
2. **Microfinance Groups** - Savings groups tracking loan repayments, contributions, and financial planning
3. **Community Organizations** - Groups coordinating community events, health initiatives, and education programs
4. **Market Committees** - Organizations managing local markets, vendor coordination, and logistics

### User Personas:
- **Amina** - Maize farmer and cooperative treasurer, needs to track loan repayments and coordinate with other farmers
- **Mwangi** - Community leader organizing weekly markets and community health meetings
- **Fatima** - Microfinance group chairwoman managing 30+ members' contributions and loan distribution

- Customizable status tracking (Pending â†’ In Progress â†’ Completed)

### 2. Category-Based Organization
Tasks are organized into categories relevant to cooperative activities:
- **Agriculture** - Crop cycles, harvests, farm maintenance
- **Finance** - Loan repayments, contributions, budgeting
- **Community** - Events, meetings, social initiatives
- **Education** - Training sessions, workshops, learning circles
- **Health** - Health campaigns, clinic visits, vaccination programs
- **Other** - Custom tasks not fitting other categories

### 3. Priority Management

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/taskflow.git
   cd taskflow
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

The application will start with sample data including:
- Maize harvesting task
- Microfinance loan repayment tracking
- Community market organization

---

##  Using the Application

### Creating a Task
1. Fill in the task title (required)
2. Add a description for context
3. Set priority level
4. Choose the appropriate category
5. Assign to a group or individual
6. Set due date if applicable
7. Click "Create Task"

### Managing Tasks
- **Update Status**: Click "Update Status" to cycle through Pending â†’ In Progress â†’ Completed
- **Delete Task**: Click "Delete" to remove completed or cancelled tasks
- **View Stats**: Dashboard shows real-time statistics at the top

### Best Practices
- Use clear, descriptive task titles
- Assign specific groups or individuals for accountability
- Set realistic due dates
- Update status regularly to reflect current progress

##  Security Features

### Repository Security:
- âœ… Comprehensive `.gitignore` file preventing sensitive data commits
- âœ… Environment variable exclusions (`.env`, `secrets.yml`)
- âœ… Dependency directory exclusions (`venv/`, `node_modules/`)
- âœ… IDE-specific file exclusions

### Branch Protection (GitHub Configuration Required):
The `main` branch must be configured with protection rules:
- Require pull request before merging
- Require minimum 1 approval
- Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- Include administrators (enforce for everyone)

**Configuration:** GitHub repository â†’ Settings â†’ Branches â†’ Add protection rule for `main`

##  Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot run the application
- **Solution**: Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed and virtual environment is activated

### Issue: Port 5000 already in use
- **Solution**: Change the port in `app.py`:
  ```python
  app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
  ```

### Issue: Tasks not persisting
- **Solution**: Check that `tasks.json` file is writable and not in `.gitignore`
